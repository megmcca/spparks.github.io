diffusion/multiphase command :h3

[Syntax:]

diffusion/multiphase keyword args :pre

keyword = {phase} or {pin} or {weight} :ulb,l
  {phase} arg = ID
    ID = phase label (integer)
  {pin} arg = ID
    ID = phase label (integer) for a pinned phase
  {weight} args = w pair i j
    w = weight applied between phases i and j
    pair = required keyword
    i,j = pair of phase labels :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

diffusion/multiphase pin 1
diffusion/multiphase phase 2
diffusion/multiphase phase 3
diffusion/multiphase weight 0.5 pair 2 3 :pre

[Description:]

This is an optional command used with the "app_style
diffusion/multiphase"_app_diffusion_multiphase.html application.

The command is typically used multiple times, each time with one of 3
keywords.

The {phase} keyword defines a phase with an integer phase label.

The {pin} keyword also defines a phase with an integer phase label and
pins the phase, so that its sites never change values due to swaps in
the diffusion application.  I.e. the sites in a pinned phase do not
diffuse.  At most one phase can be pinned.

The contribution of the energy of a pinned site to the total system
energy does not change over time.  However, pinned sites do contribute
to the energy of neighboring sites in the usual way.

The {weight} keyword specifes pairwise bond energy weights between
phases.  The default for all weights is 1.0.  A weight that
is specified for an I,J pair will also be applied to J,I.

In the 4 example lines above, 3 phases are defined.  Phase 1 is
pinned, phases 2 and 3 are not.  A weight of 0.5 is applied to the 2,3
pair of phases.  The weights for the 1,2 and 1,3 pairing are the
default values of 1.0.

[Restrictions:]

This command can only be used with the "app_style
diffusion/multiphase"_app_diffusion_multiphase.html application.

[Related commands:]

[Default:] 

No phases defined, weights are all 1.0.
