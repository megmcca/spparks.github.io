<H3>diffusion/multiphase command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>diffusion/multiphase keyword args 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>keyword = <I>phase</I> or <I>pin</I> or <I>weight</I> 

<PRE>  <I>phase</I> arg = ID
    ID = phase label (integer)
  <I>pin</I> arg = ID
    ID = phase label (integer) for a pinned phase
  <I>weight</I> args = w pair i j
    w = weight applied between phases i and j
    pair = required keyword
    i,j = pair of phase labels

</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is an optional command used with the <A HREF = "app_diffusion_multiphase.html">app_style
diffusion/multiphase</A> application.
</P>
<P>The command is typically used multiple times, each time with one of 3
keywords.
</P>
<P>The <I>phase</I> keyword defines a phase with an integer phase label.
</P>
<P>The <I>pin</I> keyword also defines a phase with an integer phase label and
pins the phase, so that its sites never change values due to swaps in
the diffusion application.  I.e. the sites in a pinned phase do not
diffuse.  At most one phase can be pinned.
</P>
<P>The contribution of the energy of a pinned site to the total system
energy does not change over time.  However, pinned sites do contribute
to the energy of neighboring sites in the usual way.
</P>
<P>The <I>weight</I> keyword specifes pairwise bond energy weights between
phases.  The default for all weights is 1.0.  A weight that
is specified for an I,J pair will also be applied to J,I.
</P>
<P>In the 4 example lines above, 3 phases are defined.  Phase 1 is
pinned, phases 2 and 3 are not.  A weight of 0.5 is applied to the 2,3
pair of phases.  The weights for the 1,2 and 1,3 pairing are the
default values of 1.0.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This command can only be used with the <A HREF = "app_diffusion_multiphase.html">app_style
diffusion/multiphase</A> application.
