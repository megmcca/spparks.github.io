External Tools for use with SPPARKS :h3

This page gives pointers to software written and maintained by other
groups which can be used with SPPARKS.

We think these kinds of tools, whether freeware or commercial, can be
very useful. They extend the scope of problems that SPPARKS can
model. We are happy to advertise software here, so that SPPARKS users
can try it out. Send us an email if you want to add something to the
list.

"Chemistream"_https://chemistream.io - For HPC Materials Simulations
in the Cloud :link(chemistream)

Chemistream provides a streamlined, easy to use framework for managing
complex HPC materials simulation workflows on various hardware
platforms. The philosophy behind Chemistream is that it makes cloud
resources accessible in order to provide small and medium-sized
industries with the access they need without having an extensive
investment into expensive software or hardware solutions.

Improving the adoption of computational chemistry software is
addressed by developing a framework to help streamline complex
simulation workflows involving one or more of the following
computational methods: molecular dynamics (LAMMPS), quantum
chemistry/electronic-structure, molecular docking, kinetic Monte-Carlo
(SPPARKS), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and
others.
