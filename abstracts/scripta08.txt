[Three-Dimensional Simulation of Grain Growth of in a Thermal Gradient
with Non-Uniform Grain Boundary Mobility]

(2008).

While grain growth studies often presume uniform grain boundary
mobility, in many real systems, grain boundary mobility is not
uniform, and can in fact vary with temperature, crystallographic
misorientation and other variables. A Monte Carlo Potts model has been
used to simulate three-dimensional curvature-driven grain growth in
systems with and without a non-uniform grain boundary mobility that
simulates a thermal gradient. Grain evolution in these systems
confirms that grain growth kinetics and grain size distributions are
locally normal.
