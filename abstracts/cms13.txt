In this work, we introduce and demonstrate a hybrid model that
combines elements of the Monte Carlo Potts Model with those of the
phase field model. This hybrid model is introduced as a method to
simulate microstructural evolution processes that are kinetically
controlled by long-range diffusion in multi-component systems. The
hybrid model uses a digitized microstructure with each site
characterized by its microstructural features and its composition. The
total free energy of the system is defined by bulk chemical free
energy as well as interfacial energy. The coupling between the
microstructure and composition is achieved by using the total free
energy to drive the evolution in both fields. The kinetics are
simulated by a combination of Monte Carlo methods and solution of the
Cahn-Hilliard equation. This model is applied to several example
problems to demonstrate its capabilities. These are diffusion in
single- and two-phase diffusion couples, grain growth in a two-phase
system controlled by diffusion and diffusion phase transformation by
nucleation and growth of a second phase.
