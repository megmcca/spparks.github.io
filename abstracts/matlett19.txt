[Modeling analysis of grain morphologies in Directed energy deposition
(DED) coating with different laser scanning patterns]

W. Li and M. Soshi, Materials Letters, 251, 8-12 (2019).

Directed energy deposition (DED) is often utilized to coat metallic
part with complex geometries in a variety of anti-corrosion materials
or high-temperature materials. Computer-controlled scanning pat- terns
always affect the grain morphology in coating, which can further
influence coatingâ€™s mechanical properties. In this study, a Kinetic
Monte Carlo (KMC) Potts model is applied to predict the grain morphol-
ogy under two different frequently-used laser scanning patterns:
unidirectional and bidirectional raster patterns. Then the predicted
grain morphologies in coatings with these two scanning patters were
quan- tified and analyzed respectively. The simulated results were
verified with an electron backscatter diffrac- tion (EBSD) image of
SS304 DED part reported by a literature. It was found that the primary
grain morphology in coating was columnar shape. Some fine equiaxed
grains appeared near the center line of scanning path. However, the
columnar grains had crescentic shapes under unidirectional pattern,
which was different from the linear shape of columnar grains under
bidirectional pattern.
