<P>Ability to accelerate the morphological evolution of nanoscale
precipitates is a fundamental challenge for atomistic
simulations. Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) methodology is an effective
approach for accelerating the evolution of nanoscale systems that are
dominated by so-called rare events. The quality and accuracy of energy
landscape used in KMC calculations can be significantly improved using
DFT-informed interatomic potentials. Using newly developed
computational framework that uses molecular simulator LAMMPS as a
library function inside KMC solver SPPARKS, we investigated formation
and growth of Guiner–Preston (GP) zones in dilute Al–Cu alloys at
different temperature and copper concentrations. The KMC simulations
with angular dependent potential (ADP) predict formation of coherent
disc-shaped monolayers of copper atoms (GPI zones) in early
stage. Such monolayers are then gradually transformed into
energetically favored GPII phase that has two aluminum layers
sandwiched between copper layers. We analyzed the growth kinetics of
KMC trajectory using Johnson–Mehl–Avrami (JMA) theory and obtained a
phase transformation index close to 1.0. In the presence of grain
boundaries, the KMC calculations predict the segregation of copper
atoms near the grain boundaries instead of formation of GP zones. The
computational framework presented in this work is based on open source
potentials and MD simulator and can predict morphological changes
during the evolution of the alloys in the bulk and around grain
boundaries.
