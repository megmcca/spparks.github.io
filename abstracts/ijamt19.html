<P>Directed energy deposition (DED) is an advanced additive manufacturing
process which can deposit or fabricate a part with complex and
nontraditional geometries in many kinds of engineering structural
materials, high-temperature materials, and anti-corrosion
materials. The fed metallic powder is melted by a laser beam with
highly concentrated energy on the substrate surface. In this
manufacturing process, different laser transverse speeds can
significantly affect the microstructural morphology of the deposited
layer. Some microstructural morphologies observed in DED may appear in
classic solidification processes. However, the effect of mobile heat
sources which vary with time and location can result in significant
microstructural heterogeneity. In order to investigate the laser
transverse speedsâ€™ effects on the microstructural morphology in DED
processes, a Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) Potts model was utilized to
exactly predict the grain evolvement under different laser transverse
speeds in this study. Three increasing transverse speeds, 450 mm/min,
600 mm/min, and 1000 mm/min, were chosen and then investigated. The
predicted microstructural morphology in depositions with these three
different laser transverse speeds was quantified and analyzed. The
processing parameters in the KMC Potts model were cited from a
previous reference and have been validated with experimental EBSD
microstructural images.
