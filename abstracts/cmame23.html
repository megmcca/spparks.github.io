<P>This work describes a Metropolis Monte Carlo model for modeling
additively manufactured metallic microstructures which employs Bézier
curves to formulate melt pool geometry induced by a moving laser heat
source. With this formulation, a wide range of melt pool geometries
can be modeled and their effects on microstructure morphologies can be
evaluated. Melt pool geometries are fit with Bézier curves using melt
pool dimensions of width, length, and depth obtained from FEM
calculations of the thermal process. Assuming a steady state pool
geometry, microstructures are simulated incrementally in the heat
affected zone in much the same way an additively manufactured material
part is built. The approach is computationally tractable as
microstructure simulation is only required in the fusion and heat
affected zones, thus requiring less computational resources than would
be needed if the entire material/part domain was taken into
account. Using the model, microstructures are simulated for LENS™
processed stainless steel. Demonstrations show the model can replicate
microstructure morphologies seen in electron beam backscatter
diffraction data.
