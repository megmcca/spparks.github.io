<P>Using the kinetic Monte Carlo simulator, Stochastic Parallel PARticle
Kinetic Simulator, from Sandia National Laboratories, a user routine
has been developed to simulate mesoscale predictions of a grain
structure near a moving heat source. Here, we demonstrate the use of
this user routine to produce voxelized, synthetic, three-dimensional
microstructures for electronbeam welding by comparing them with
experimentally produced microstructures.  When simulation input
parameters are matched to experimental process parameters, qualitative
and quantitative agreement for both grain size and grain morphology
are achieved. The method is capable of simulating both single- and
multipass welds. The simulations provide an opportunity for not only
accelerated design but also the integration of simulation and
experiments in design such that simulations can receive parameter
bounds from experiments and, in turn, provide predictions of a
resultant microstructure.
