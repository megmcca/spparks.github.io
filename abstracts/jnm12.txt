High burn-up, rim structures within uranium dioxide (UO2) light water
reactor fuels exhibit marked differences in microstructure that are
attributed to dynamic recrystallization. The recrystallization process
has three distinct, interacting components: damage accumulation,
nucleation and growth of damage- free regions, and subsequent
evolution of recrystallized grains. In this paper,
microstructural-scale simulation techniques for all three processes
are presented and assembled into a hybrid tool for modeling the entire
dynamic recrystallization process. The components of the model include
a phenomenological model for damage accumulation and nucleation, a
Cellular Automaton (CA) model for the growth and impingement of
recrystallized grains, and a kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) Potts model for
subsequent grain growth. Preliminary results of the hybrid model
demonstrate the evolution of a steady state grain size.  Parametric
simulations show the dependence of the steady state grain size on
physical variables and on system size.
