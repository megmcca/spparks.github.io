Experimental grain growth observations often deviate from grain growth
simulations, revealing that the governing rules for grain boundary
motion are not fully understood. A novel deep learning model was
developed to capture grain growth behavior from training data without
making assumptions about the underlying physics. The
Physics-Regularized Interpretable Machine Learning Microstructure
Evolution (PRIMME) model consists of a multi-layer neural network that
predicts the likelihood of a point changing to a neighboring
grain. Here, we demonstrate PRIMME’s ability to replicate
two-dimensional normal grain growth by training it with Monte Carlo
Potts simulations. The trained PRIMME model’s grain growth predictions
in several test cases show good agreement with analytical models,
phase-field simulations, Monte Carlo Potts simulations, and results
from the literature. Additionally, PRIMME’s adaptability to
investigate irregular grain growth behavior is shown. Important
aspects of PRIMME like interpretability, regularization,
extrapolation, and overfitting are also discussed.
