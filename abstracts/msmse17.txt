Welding is one of the most wide-spread processes used in metal
joining.  However, there are currently no open-source software
implementations for the simulation of microstructural evolution during
a weld pass. Here we describe a Potts Monte Carlo based model
implemented in the SPPARKS kinetic Monte Carlo computational
framework. The model simulates melting, solidification and solid-state
microstructural evolution of material in the fusion and heataffected
zones of a weld. The model does not simulate thermal behavior, but
rather utilizes user input parameters to specify weld pool and
heat-affect zone properties. Weld pool shapes are specified by BÃ©zier
curves, which allow for the specification of a wide range of pool
shapes. Pool shapes can range from narrow and deep to wide and shallow
representing different fluid flow conditions within the
pool. Surrounding temperature gradients are calculated with the aide
of a closest point projection algorithm. The model also allows
simulation of pulsed power welding through time-dependent variation of
the weld pool size. Example simulation results and comparisons with
laboratory weld observations demonstrate microstructural variation
with weld speed, pool shape, and pulsed-power.
