<P>To investigate the atomic layer deposition (ALD) reactions for growth
of HfO2 from Hf(NMe2)4 (TDMAHf) and H2O, a density functional theory
(DFT) slab model was employed.  We inspected all energy steps, from
the early stage of adsorption of each ALD precursor to the
densification of multiple atoms into bulk-like HfO2 layers. The
activation energy calculations show that repeated proton diffusion
from the surface to amide ligands and rotation of the protonated amine
is more energetically accessible than the simple elimination of the
amine in the initial stage. We therefore propose that multiple protons
diffuse to the amide ligands of the Hf precursor before desorption of
protonated ligands takes place. Loss of a proton from surface oxygen
frees it up for bonding to Hf of the precursor. Protonation of
ligands, and especially desorption of ligands, frees up Hf for bonding
to surface oxygen. These effects are termed “densification”, as they
bring Hf−O packing closer to the bulk scenario. Densification is
associated with substantial release of energy. During the metal pulse,
saturation of the surface by remaining fragments HfX causes adsorption
of further metal precursor to stop. The presence of these fragments
prevents further chemisorption of HfX4, since this requires the
creation of a strong dative bond between Hf and O.  Next, during the
H2O pulse, Hf exchanges its remaining ligands with OH groups. The
exchange occurs due to the decomposition of adsorbed H2O molecules in
clusters of HfX. Decomposition of H2O when adsorbed onto a (Hf(NMe2))x
(x ≥ 2) cluster (e.g., dimers) also increases the coordination of Hf
and O. Simultaneously, low-coordinated oxygen atoms appear at the
surface, which are reactive sites for the next metal pulse. With
saturation of the surface by OH groups, H2O molecules begin to
appear. This detailed description of ALD chemistry allows us to make
qualitative predictions about how the process depends on temperature.
The data can also be inputted into kinetic simulations for a
quantitative view of the complex film growth process.
